# Medichain-Electronic-Health-Record-EHR
# Abstract
Blockchain is a technology designed to manage electronic data that has the potential to support transparency and accountability. A blockchain is a ledger of transactions where an identical copy is visible to all the members of a computer network. Network members validate the data entered into the ledger and once entered, the data are immutable. Blockchain was originally developed for cryptocurrencies to eliminate the need for intermediaries, such as banks while protecting against a high risk of fraud and theft. In the health sector, there are transactions where transparent and immutable record keeping may also be important, such as purchasing and shipping transactions in supply chains for medical equipment and pharmaceuticals; and tracking permissions and access of personnel to facilities, medical records, or other health data. Questions for policymakers include, to what degree is blockchain necessary to preserve the integrity of these transactions? Do its costs and benefits compare favorably against alternative technologies, such as a traditional, centrally-managed, database? While well-established systems for assessing pharmaceutical innovations exist, there is no equivalent for other types of innovations, including digital solutions. Often there is an asymmetry of information between software vendors and purchasers that can place health systems at a disadvantage. This is particularly problematic for blockchain-enabled solutions because there are few practical applications.
# Objectives

Medichain provides the feature of healthcare system, blockchain systems requires a new way of thinking about data and information. Users of this technology, including patients and the public, must be educated regarding the features of this technology and the implications of its use for data ownership, access and privacy.
We advocate the international community and our governments to incorporate the implementation of such systems. The current system has proven to fail in both security , accessibility and data privacy. It's time for the revelation to better the lives of our loved ones  and save millions of dollars trying to maintain and push a broken system.
# MEDICHAIN SYSTEM ORVERVIEW
Medichain is an Electronic Health Record (EHR): an electronic version of a patient's medical history,
that is maintained by the provider over time and may include all of the key administrative clinical data
relevant to that person's care under a particular provider, including demographics, progress notes,
problems, medications.
The system comes with a mobile application for the patient end user. Having lots of functionality for
better serving the patient.Some of the functionality and features of the mobile application includes:
The patient is able to get and access his or her medical health record in real-time at whatever time
and place. It eliminates the need for a third party in tempering or violation of data privacy by the
hospital staff.
